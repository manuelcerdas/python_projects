Small Ptyhon projects I'm doing to learn

**PlotMovies** This is an example of a KNN Reader.  It classifies the movies in the "newMovies.json" file as Action or Romance, using the movies in "movies.json" as reference.. It also creates a scatter plot with the movies (based on the example from chapter 2 of "Machine Learning in Action" by Peter Harrington).

**Life** An implementation of the Conway's "Game of Life"  (based on Chapter 3 of "Python Playground" by Mahesh Venkitachalam).

In the **Tortuga** folder I have a few small graphics projects using the turtle

**Tortuga/square_spiral**: my first attempt to use the turtle, just draw a square spiral
**Tortuga/circle_square**: draws a circle like shape using squares
**Tortuga/polygon**: draws a polygon with the ammount of sides specified by the user
