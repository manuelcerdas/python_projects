Small Ptyhon projects I'm doing to learn

**PlotMovies** This is an example of a KNN Reader.  It classifies the movies in the "newMovies.json" file as Action or Romance, using the movies in "movies.json" as reference.. It also creates a scatter plot with the movies (based on the example from chapter 2 of "Machine Learning in Action" by Peter Harrington).

**DatingKNN** Another example of a KNN reader, this time getting the data from a text file (based on the example from chapter 2 of "Machine Learning in Action" by Peter Harrington).

**Life** An implementation of the Conway's "Game of Life"  (based on Chapter 3 of "Python Playground" by Mahesh Venkitachalam).

**Map** A Costa Rica Choropleth map that displays birth data in the first semester of 2021.   Please use map_v2.py, since it's the most refined version.  I'm keeping the other version as a reference

**Tortuga/square_spiral**: my first attempt to use the turtle, just draw a square spiral
**Tortuga/circle_square**: draws a circle like shape using squares
